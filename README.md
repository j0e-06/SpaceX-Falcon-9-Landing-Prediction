# SpaceX-Falcon-9-Landing-Prediction
Data Science Capstone Project – Predicting Falcon 9 first stage landing success

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.
The objective is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully,
which directly impacts launch cost estimation.

## Lab 1: Data Collection
- Request to the SpaceX API
- Clean the requested data

## Lab 2: Web scraping Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Launches Records from Wikipedia
- Extract a Falcon 9 launch records HTML table from Wikipedia 
- Parse the table and convert it into a Pandas data frame

## Lab 3: Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Determine Training Labels

## Lab 4: Complete the EDA with SQL
- Understand the Spacex DataSet
- Load the dataset into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
- Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

## Lab 5: EDA with Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preparing Data Feature Engineering
