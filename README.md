# SpaceX-Falcon-9-Landing-Prediction
Data Science Capstone Project – Predicting Falcon 9 first stage landing success

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.
The objective is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully,
which directly impacts launch cost estimation.

## Lab 1: Data Collection
- Request to the SpaceX API
- Clean the requested data

## Lab 2: Web scraping Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Launches Records from Wikipedia
- Extract a Falcon 9 launch records HTML table from Wikipedia 
- Parse the table and convert it into a Pandas data frame

## Lab 3: Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Determine Training Labels

## Lab 4: Complete the EDA with SQL
- Understand the Spacex DataSet
- Load the dataset into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
- Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

## Lab 5: EDA with Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preparing Data Feature Engineering

## Lab 6: Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium
- TASK 1: Mark all launch sites on a map
- TASK 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
- TASK 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities

## Lab 7: Build an Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash
- TASK 1: Add a Launch Site Drop-down Input Component
- TASK 2: Add a callback function to render success-pie-chart based on selected site dropdown
- TASK 3: Add a Range Slider to Select Payload
- TASK 4: Add a callback function to render the success-payload-scatter-chart scatter plot

## Lab 8: Complete the Machine Learning Prediction lab
- Perform exploratory Data Analysis and determine Training Labels:
Create a column for the class.
Standardize the data.
Split into training data and test data.
- Find best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression:
Find the method performs best using test data.
